# Introduction
The Fatal Accidents 2007 dataset consists all fatal accidents on public roads reported to the national highway transportation safety administration. I am using R for analyzing dataset by using different graphical interpretations and prediction model to find the solutions for the following research questions.
1.Fatalities by month, day of week, hour, state
2.Crash counts by Roadway function class, Route, Relation to road, Speed limit, light conditions,
3.Pedestrians involved in accident, Number of hit and run cases in accidents
4.Which type of accidents are more frequent in different road types
5.Accidents by alignment and number of lanes, Surrounding conditions and traffic controls functioning,
weather conditions and roadway traffic flow.
